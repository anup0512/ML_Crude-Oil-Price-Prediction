Crude Oil Price Prediction: Advanced Time Series Analysis  

**Description**:  
Developed a robust time series forecasting model to predict daily crude oil prices, leveraging advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. Key project highlights include:  
- **Data Preparation**: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and ensured data consistency through resampling and interpolation.  
- **Model Experimentation**: Explored various algorithms, including ARIMA, SARIMAX, Holt's Winter Method, LSTM, and Facebook Prophet.  
- **Performance Optimization**: Identified Facebook Prophet as the best-performing model with a low RMSE of 7.46.  
- **Deployment**: Deployed the model using Streamlit, enabling users to customize forecast horizons (e.g., up to 1 year).  
- **Forecast Insights**: Provided a clear forecast of upward trends in crude oil prices, offering valuable insights for decision-making.
